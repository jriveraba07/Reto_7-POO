Reto 7 de POO: json, queues y named tuples
---
Restaurant (again):
- Add the proper data structure to manage multiple orders (maybe a FIFO queue)
- Define a named tuple somewhere in the menu, e.g. to define a set of items.
- Create an interface in the order class, to create a new menu, aggregate the functions for add, update, delete items. All the menus should be stored as JSON files. (use dicts for this task.)
